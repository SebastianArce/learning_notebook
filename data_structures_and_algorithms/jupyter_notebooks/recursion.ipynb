    "# Recursion\n",

    "## What is Recursion?\n",
    "A recursive function solves a particular problem by calling a copy of itself and solving smaller subproblems of the original problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Need of Recursion\n",
    "Recursion is an amazing technique with the help of which we can reduce the length of our code and make it easier to read and write. A task that can be defined with its similar subtask, recursion is one of the best solutions for it. \n",
    "* For example, the factorial of a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties of Recursion:\n",
    "* Performing the same operations multiple times with different inputs.\n",
    "* In every step, we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller. \n",
    "* Base condition is needed to stop the recursion otherwise infinite loop will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Steps\n",
    "* Step 1 - Define a base case: \n",
    "    * Identify the simplest case for which the solution is known or trivial. This is the stopping condition for the recursion, as it prevents the function from infinitely calling itself. \n",
    "* Step 2 - Define a recursive case: \n",
    "    * Define the problem in terms of smaller subproblems. Break the problem down into smaller versions of itself, and call the function recursively to solve each subproblem. \n",
    "* Step 3 - Ensure the recursion terminates: \n",
    "    *  Make sure that the recursive function eventually reaches the base case, and does not enter an infinite loop. \n",
    "* Step 4 - Combine the solutions: \n",
    "    * Combine the solutions of the subproblems to solve the original problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Memory\n",
    "Recursion uses more memory, because the recursive function adds to the stack with each recursive call, and keeps the values there untl the call is finished. The recursive functions uses LIFO (LAST IN FIRST OUT) structure just like the stack data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stack Overflow\n",
    "If the base case is not reached or not defined, then the stack overflow problem may arise. "

    "## Real Applications of Recursion in real problems\n",
    "- **Tree and graph traversal**: Recursion is frequently used for traversing and searching data structures such as trees and graphs. Recursive algorithms can be used to explore all the nodes or vertices of a tree or graph in a systematic way. \n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "- **Sorting algorithms**: Recursive algorithms are also used in sorting algorithms such as quicksort and merge sort. These algorithms use recursion to divide the data into smaller subarrays or sublists, sort them, and then merge them back together.\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "- **Divide-and-conquer algorithms**: Many algorithms that use a divide-and-conquer approach, such as the binary search algorithm, use recursion to break down the problem into smaller subproblems.\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "- **Fractal generation**: Fractal shapes and patterns can be generated using recursive algorithms. For example, the Mandelbrot set is generated by repeatedly applying a recursive formula to complex numbers.\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "- **Backtracking algorithms**: Backtracking algorithms are used to solve problems that involve making a sequence of decisions, where each decision depends on the previous ones. These algorithms can be implemented using recursion to explore all possible paths and backtrack when a solution is not found.\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "- **Memoization**: Memoization is a technique that involves storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. Memoization can be implemented using recursive functions to compute and cache the results of subproblems."
