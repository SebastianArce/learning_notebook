    "# Boosting\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "- Boosting refers to an ensemble method in which several models are trained sequentially with each model learning from the errors of its predecessors. \n",
    "- **Weak learner**: model doing slightly better than random guessing (example a CART whose maximum depth is 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types**:\n",
    "- AdaBoost: \n",
    "    - Adaptive Boosting, each predictor pays more attention to the instances wrongly predicted by its predecessor. \n",
    "    - Achieved by changing the weights of training instances.\n",
    "    - Each predictor is assigned a coefficient alpha.\n",
    "    - Alpha depends on the predictor's training error. \n",
    "- Gradient Boosting:\n",
