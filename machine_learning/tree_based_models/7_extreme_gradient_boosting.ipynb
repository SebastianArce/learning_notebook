    "# Extreme Gradient Boosting with XGBoost\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "* Boosting converts a collection of weak learners into a strong learner. \n",
    "    * **weak learner**: ML algorithm that is slightly better than chance (>50%)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "1. Iteratively learning a set of weak models on subsets of the data\n",
    "2. Weighing each weak prediction according to each weak learner's performance\n",
    "3. Combine the weighted predictinons to obtain a single weighted prediction \n",
    "4. ... that is much better than the individual predictions themselves! \n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "* Speed and performance\n",
    "* Core algorithm is parallelizable (good for big data)\n",
    "* **Consistently outperforms single-algorithm methods**\n",
    "* State-of-the-art performance in many ML tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-validation\n",
    "* Is a robust method for estimating the performance of a model on unseen data\n",
    "* Generates many non-overlapping train/test splits on training  data\n",
    "* Reports the average test set performance across all data splits\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common loss functions in XGBoost\n",
    "* Loss function names in xgboost:\n",
    "    *reg:linear - use for regression problems\n",
    "    *reg:logistic - use for classification problem when you want just decision, not probability\n",
    "    *binary:logistic - use when you want probability rather than just decision\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base learners\n",
    "* XGBoost involves creating a meta-model that is composed of many individual models that combine to give a final prediction\n",
    "    * Individual models = base learners\n",
    "    * Want base learners that when combined create final prediction that is non-linear\n",
    "    * Each base learner should be good at distinguishing or predicting different parts of the dataset\n",
    "    * Two kinds of base learners:\n",
    "        * tree\n",
    "        * linear\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use XGBoost\n",
    "* You have a large number of training samples\n",
    "    * Greater than 1000 training samples and less 100 features\n",
    "    * The number of features < number of training samples\n",
    "* You have a mixture of categorical and numeric features\n",
    "    * Or just numeric features\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to NOT use XGBoost\n",
    "* All of these problems can be better tackled by Deep Learning\n",
    "    * Image recognition\n",
    "    * Computer vision\n",
    "    * NLP\n",
    "* Small datasets\n",
