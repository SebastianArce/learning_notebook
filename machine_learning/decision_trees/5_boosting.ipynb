    "# Boosting\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "- Boosting refers to an ensemble method in which several models are trained sequentially with each model learning from the errors of its predecessors. \n",
    "- **Weak learner**: model doing slightly better than random guessing (example a CART whose maximum depth is 1)\n",
    "    - **Stump**: A tree with only one node and two leaves is called a stump. Stumps are not great at making classifications. \n",
    "        - In a forest of stumps made with Adaboost, some stumps have more weight on their vote than others (unlike a random forest)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- ***Boosting reduces bias, not variance. Thus, it tries to reduce the problem of underfitting the data.***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types\n",
    "- **AdaBoost** (Adaptive Boosting): \n",
    "    - Combines a lot of 'weak learners' to make classifications.\n",
    "    - Linear, not in parallel\n",
    "        - The errors that the first tree makes influence how the second tree is made... and so on.\n",
    "    - Some trees have more weight on their vote than others\n",
    "    - **Steps**:\n",
    "        1. An equal weight is given to each sample (how important the sample is). \n",
    "        2. Make the first stump in the forest. \n",
    "            2.1 Find which feature gives the lower impurity (or gini index), to know which variable will be the node of the stump\n",
    "        3. ...hehe\n",
    "    - **Parameters**:\n",
    "        - Learning rate (between 0 and 1) - etha\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gradient Boosting**:\n",
    "    - Like AdaBoost, Gradient Boost builds fixed sized trees based on the previous tree's errors, but unlike AdaBoost, each tree can be larger than a stump\n",
    "    - Maximum number of leaves should be around 8 and 32 (of each decision tree)\n",
    "    - **Cons**:\n",
    "        - GB involves an exhaustive search procedure\n",
    "        - Each CART is trained to find the best split points and features\n",
    "        - May lead to CARTs using the same split points and maybe the same features\n",
    "        - Solution: Stochastic Gradient Boosting\n",
